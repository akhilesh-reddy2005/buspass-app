## 🛠️ How It Works

### For Students:
1. **Apply for Bus Pass**: Submit bus pass application through the normal process
2. **Admin Approval**: Wait for admin to approve the request
3. **QR Code Generation**: Once approved, a unique QR code is automatically generated
4. **View E-Pass**: Access your e-pass with the QR code in the "My E-Pass" section
5. **Show for Verification**: Present the QR code to transport staff or validators

### For Admins:
1. **Review Applications**: View pending bus pass requests
2. **Set Validity Period**: Choose from preset options (30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years)

4. **Monitor Active Passes**: Track all active passes and their expiry dates

### For Verifiers (Transport Staff):

3. **View Pass Details**: See student information, route, pickup point, and validity status
4. **Instant Validation**: Get immediate confirmation of pass authenticity
